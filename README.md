# Data Encryption and Decryption Utility in Go

## Overview

This project is a simple utility for encrypting and decrypting files and messages using Go. It provides a straightforward interface to secure sensitive data through encryption.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages**: Securely encrypt a given message.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Decrypt previously encrypted messages.
- **Encrypt Files**: Encrypt files to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Decrypt Files**: Decrypt files back to their original state.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.16 or later installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Go programming.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataEncryptionUtility.git
   cd DataEncryptionUtility
Make sure you have Go installed. Verify by running:
bash
Copy code
go version
Usage
To run the utility, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go

Functions
EncryptFile(filename string): Encrypts the specified file.
EncryptMessage(message string): Returns the encrypted version of the provided message.
DecryptFile(filename string): Decrypts the specified file.
DecryptMessage(encryptedMessage string): Returns the decrypted version of the provided encrypted message.

Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the functions:
// Encrypt a message
encryptedMsg, err := EncryptMessage("Hello, World!")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error encrypting message:", err)
}
fmt.Println("Encrypted message:", encryptedMsg)

// Decrypt the message
decryptedMsg, err := DecryptMessage(encryptedMsg)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error decrypting message:", err)
}
fmt.Println("Decrypted message:", decryptedMsg)
